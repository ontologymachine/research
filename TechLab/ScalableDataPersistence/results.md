TODO:
* hot/cold storage + backup, seeding logic
* different levels of data caching / storage using chain -> feeds (fixed size history + persistent bookmarks)(local and remote replication).

# Hot Storage Mathematical Modeling
Create a statistical model that is able to derive storage time guarentees given various metrics. (amount of data, how long, local upper bound, network conditions)
