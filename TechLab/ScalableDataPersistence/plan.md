Plan for the research experiment/project.
=========================================

# Tech Architecture
hot vs cold storage

# Hot Storage Mathematical Modeling
Create a statistical model that is able to derive storage time guarentees given various system conditions. (amount of data, how long, local upper bound, network conditions)
