Bankruptsy is a very useful model. It shows where an industry is weak and ripe for subsumption by another industry.

Picture a map of the US that's being gradually overtaken by Amazon, KMart, and Target. First each of them has to buyh the different verticals:
* cheap factory for buying / shipping (supply chain)
* then the paths through which they concor the different areas

Looking at the different types of bankruptsys that are happening and how they're divided up (Toys R Us, regional grocery store, etc), we hypothesize you can predict the next moves of these different companies as they start to congele in their strategy and start to merge with eachother.

Another example, looking at something like Air BnB and We Work. If you look at the preferential treatment and legislation crackdowns by legal structures, we hypothesize that air bnb vs we work is going to be a vertical of competition that doesn't currently exist.

Mover predictors? Looking at one city... a very narrow scope... these are the:
* Bankruptcys that are meant to happen within next year
* Company financial
* Legal thought progression
